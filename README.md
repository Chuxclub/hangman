# Hangman
Hangman game playable in Bash shell, this is pretty much it.

This project works but I'm new to programming and hence lack lots of concepts so if you have a look in the source code you'll probably find that's it's a genuine mess despite my efforts to clean it.

If you want to use it you have to follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open terminal using Ctrl + Alt + t shortcut
3. Enter in the terminal: gedit ~/.bash_aliases
4. Enter in ~/.bash_aliases file: alias hangman='cd ~/hangman && ./hangman && cd -'

Note: You can change the directory in which you save hangman, just edit cd ~/hangman in step 4 with the corresponding path

Constructive criticism would be more than welcome though (but keep in mind that I'm NEW to programming so please adapt your comments to my level, I'd more than grateful if you did) !

Enjoy your day!

IMPORTANT: If you want to exit mid-game you can enter 'exit'. Command is not indicated in the software, it'll be in the future though.

Note 2: Ideas for the future -> Add a versus mode, add an option mode with the possibility to change language and colors,
add a translation dictionary so that game can be useful to learn words in foreign languages, add difficulty levels, add Qt window.
